	  <div class = "aligned">
	  

	  <img src="./icons/united.jpg" class="responsive"><div id ="TitleDesc"><div class = "info"> Information On Titles</div>  Who has won the most Premier League titles? Well, isn't it obvious? Manchester United have secured 13 of the 28 Premier League title to date, the last of which arrived in 2013.
	  Only seven clubs have had their hands on the Premier League trophy and they are Chelsea (5 times), Man City (times), Arsenal (3 times), Blackburn Rovers, Leicester and Liverpool (1 time).

Man Utd also hold the record for the most consecutive title wins. The Red Devils claimed three Premier League titles on the run between 1998-2001 and again from 2006-2009. However, 
it is their local rivals Man City that hold the record for the biggest winning margin in Premier League history. City claimed the 2017/18 title, 19pts clear of second-placed Man Utd. City also hold the record for the narrowest Premier League title win, 
when they finished level on points with Man Utd but had a goal difference that was +8 better than their arch-rivals.
<span id = "important">This is only based on the seasons after the league changed name, English Football League to Premier League. If all seasons going back to the year 1888 would be included the list would look different. Manchester United would still be on top with 20 titles, 
but Liverpool would come as the second best with 19 titles.</span></div></div>

Amazingly, Liverpool hold the record for the most points secured in a single season without winning the title. The Reds finished behind Man City in 2018/19 despite securing an impressive 97pts and agonisingly, City only won the title that season by a single point. 
The record for the fewest points earned by any Premier League champion goes to Man Utd, who claimed the 1996/97 league trophy with just 75pts on the board.</div></div>

	  <img src="./icons/liverpool.jpeg" class="responsive"><div id ="TitleDesc"><div class = "info"> Information On Wins</div>  Man City and Liverpool hold the record for the most amount of wins in a Premier League season, 32. City twice recorded 32 wins in a single season during the 2017/18 and the 2018/19 campaigns, while Liverpool achieved the same total in their title-winning season of 2019/20.

The unwanted record for the fewest number of wins in a single Premier League season goes to Derby County. The Rams only managed to secure one win during the 2007/08 season and were duly relegated well before the campaign came to a close.

Man City hold the record for the highest number of away wins in a single season, 16, achieved during the title-winning campaign of 2017/18. The record for the lowest number of home wins in a single season is shared between Sunderland and, of course, Derby, with the pair only managing to win once in their own backyard. 


Liverpool had an outstanding home record at Anfield, until recently, and they hold the record for the most amount of consecutive home wins in Premier League history, 
laiming 24 victories between February 2019 – July 2020..</div></div>

Arsenal are the only team never to have lost a single game in one Premier League season. ‘The Invincables', as they became known, played out the entirety of the 2003/04 season without losing a single league game, a record that other teams have come close to equaling in recent seasons but might never be repeated.

Sunderland hold the record for the most consecutive defeats in a season, 15, achieved during the 2002/03 season which duly ended in relegation for the Black Cats..</div></div>
